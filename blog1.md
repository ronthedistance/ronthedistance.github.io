###Highlights of this week

--Started playing with Jekyll, this is much better
---Did this lab
---Internship going well

###Switching to Jekyll

I don't know why I was so hardheaded about trying to do things through raw html, css, and what have you.
I had some javascript I wanted to test at some point but then realized github pages specifically only hosts static webpages.
Sooooo, no point in doing that.
Finally got off my lazy butt and decided to try Jekyll.
This is much easier and I regret being stubborn.
