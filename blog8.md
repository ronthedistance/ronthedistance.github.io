This week is our first practical foray into infrastructure as code. 

### AWS Lambda.

AWS lambda is important because it defines applications that don't need actual infrastructure to run.

Earlier in the semester we saw that ec2 instances can be used similar to cloud - based virtual machines.

AWS lambda can potentially make those obselete by being able to run the same application , but only getting billed when the code actually executes.

The following image shows the current status of our start/stop ec2 instance lambda functions.

The image shown is the simple code necessary to complete the ec2 start in this case.
