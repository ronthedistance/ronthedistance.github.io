# What to do after defining risk

Last week, I quantified risk according to VTIL, vulnerabilities, threats, impacts and likelihood.
But what do you do about risk once it's been identified?

## Handling Risk

No risk can be 100% taken care of, but there are four general actions associated with Risk.

- Transfer

This is basically what insurance is for. If the impact is financial in nature, you can transfer the impact of that financial lost to a cyber insurer rather than taking that hit all at once.

While yes, you are essentially paying for it eventually, it is better to pay over time predictably than it is to have to pay on an emergency all at once.

- Mitigate

Most typical action you take.  This means designing systems and processes that can help mitigate losses should impact occur. This can be something like enforcing least privilege, so that even if an attacker gets into the network, they can't do anything once they're in there.

- Acceptance

HOPEFULLY rare, but sometimes needs to happen. Risk is a cost/benefit measure with impact being measured against business function. If the system you are protecting produces 400 million a year, but would cost 700 million to secure, it does not make sense to spend that money.

- Denial

This is "pulling the plug" so to speak. If it is determined that the potential losses are too high, you can deny the process which generates risk from existing in the first place.
