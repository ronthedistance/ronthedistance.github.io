# Blog 5 [10.10.2019]
### Week 4

With this week comes the class' first official foray into AWS.
The first project not only introduced me to those cloud concepts but one thing I'll talk about a bit first.

### Github
So, I'm not going to lie. I'm not as well versed in github aside from commits and pushes. 
I've never had to manage the actual repositories.

```Issues``` 

We haven't used issues in our project as of yet, but through them we can assign various tasks to our group members.
It also allows you to label these issues, allowing others who visit the repository to see bugs, documentation fixes, and the like.

```Wiki```

This section is self explanatory, but it's nice to know that I was missing out on an entirely helpful section of github pages because i really only went so far as the directories I was looking for once I found the pages I wanted in google.

```Projects```

Oh. A built-in github kanban board? I'm unsure if I wanted to use this over the issues feature, but I think that for now, the kanban board is easier to follow. The biggest downside is that visibility seems to be limited to those within the actual repository. ...I think.


### First shot at AWS...
