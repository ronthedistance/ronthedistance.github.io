## Cyber Risk and what that means

A softer topic than my normal blog posts, but an important one none the less.

### Assessing Risk

There are four components of computer security risk that I like to think of.

- Vulnerability

A perceived weakness in a system that allows for the undesired handling of data

- Threat

Who / what is your threat in this case? An advanced nation-state hacker, script kiddies, HR departments, or your own sysadmins?

- Impact

Assume data loss. Assume that the perceived weakness is somehow leveraged against your system. What is lost? Do we lose money? Is our reputation tarnished? The higher the impact, the more you are losing.

- Likelihood / Probability

Is this an act that can be arbitrarily done on any given day in a couple of minutes? Or is this something that would take time, money, or effort?

Using these 4 values, we can quantify whether a risk is higher or lower than other parts of a system.

Thus, when looking at the whole process or technology, if there are multiple perceived weaknesses, we can prioritze which to address first via additional hiring, new technologies, and the like.
